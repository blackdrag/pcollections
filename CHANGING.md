First time setup:
- create a `gradle.properties` a la https://central.sonatype.org/pages/gradle.html#credentials
- download `google-java-format-1.15.0-all-deps.jar` from https://github.com/google/google-java-format/releases

To release:
- run `java -jar google-java-format-1.15.0-all-deps.jar -i src/**.java`
- remove -SNAPSHOT from the version in build.gradle
- commit with a tag
- run `./gradlew test publish`

Then follow the instructions at https://central.sonatype.org/pages/releasing-the-deployment.html

Finally, increment the version in build.gradle and add back -SNAPSHOT, and commit.

Finally finally, once the new version is available in Maven Central (takes a few hours), update the version in the Maven and Gradle snippets in the README and update CHANGELOG.md.


â€¦also, if you want to run the benchmarks:
(They're a bit janky and take forever, but you can always add your own and comment out the ones you don't want to run.)
- `./gradlew --stop; rm -fr build/ && ./gradlew jmh`
(Stopping the daemon and deleting build/ fixes issues when you're changing or commenting out benchmarks.)
