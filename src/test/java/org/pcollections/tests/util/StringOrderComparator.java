/**
 * A comparator that compares objects by their string values; for example, it reports that
 * 1 is less than 10 and 10 is less than 2, because in fact "1" is less than "10" and "10" is less
 * than "2". This is not consistent with equals over all objects, but is consistent with equals over
 * restricted domains, such as instances of java.lang.Integer, or instances of java.lang.Double.
 * (Intended for use by TreePSetTest and TreePMapTest in verifying correct handling when a custom
 * comparator is used.)
